VxWorks

VxWorks is a real-time operating system(RTOS),
witch was developed as Proprietary software by Wind River System.
VxWorks is designed for use in embedded systems requiring real-time,
deterministic performance, safety and security certification for different industries.

Real time operating system

Real-time operating system is intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in,
typically without buffer delays.

Embedded systems

An embedded system is a programmed controlling and operating system with a
dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

Platform overview

Supported architecture: Intel architecture, Power architecture, and ARM architectures.

The RTOS can be used in multi-core asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP),
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP),
and mixed modes and multi-OS(via Type 1 hypervisor) designs on 32- and 64-bit processors.

Uses

VxWorks is used by products over a wide range of market areas: aerospace and defense, automotive,
industrial such as robots, consumer electronics, medical area and networking.
